# Intermittent Div Invisibility Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to the timing of JavaScript's `setTimeout` function and the `style.display` property.  The bug results in the div element occasionally remaining invisible even after the `setTimeout` function should have made it visible. This behavior is inconsistent and does not occur every time.

## Bug Description

A div element is initially hidden using `style.display = "none"`. After a delay of 1000 milliseconds, `setTimeout` is used to set `style.display = "block"`, making it visible again.  However, in some instances, the div remains invisible, suggesting a race condition or an unexpected interaction between the JavaScript and rendering engine. 

## Solution
The solution involves using a more robust method to manage the visibility of the div and avoiding direct manipulation of `style.display` that might create inconsistencies or conflicts in rendering.
